# Today's date with leading zeros

A simple script that adds a leading '0' to any day/month less than '10'.

For example, 2nd May 2017 would simply be '2/5/2017', so this makes it '02/05/2017'.

Uses? For lining up columns of dates nicely. Or anything else you can think of.

## TODO:

Rewrite so you can use this to add leading zeros to any date passed in as a parameter.
